        <h1>THE MARTIN JAHNSEN FOUNDATION <br> CHARITY ORGANIZATION</h1>
        <p>Although Martin Jahnsen passed away in 2009 his influence continues to be felt by those who he knew.  He was a software engineer by trade, loved technology and had an equally deep love for others.  The Martin Jahnsen Foundation was created to remind us of that love by providing technology to those who need it most.</p>
